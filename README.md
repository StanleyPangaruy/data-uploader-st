A Streamlit web application for managing data in a [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) instance. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to upload data from CSV or Excel files, create new tables, insert, update, and delete rows without writing any SQL.

## Features

- **Connect to any Datasette Instance**: Works with any public or private (token-protected) Datasette URL.
- **Create Tables**: Upload a CSV or Excel file to create a new table in a selected database.
- **Insert Rows**: Append new data from a CSV or Excel file into an existing table.
- **Update Rows**: Modify existing records in a table by uploading a file containing the primary key(s) and the columns to be updated.
- **Delete Rows**: Remove specific rows from a table by providing their primary key(s).
- **Drop Tables**: Permanently delete a table and all its data from a database.
- **Data Preview**: Preview your data within the app before performing any write operation.
- **Schema Viewer**: View the schema of existing tables to ensure data compatibility.

    -   Open the application in your browser.
    -   In the sidebar, enter the full URL of your Datasette instance (e.g., `https://your-datasette.datasette.io`).
    -   If your Datasette instance requires authentication, enter the API token in the "API Token" field.

2.  **Select an Operation**:
    -   Use the main dropdown menu to choose an operation: "Create New Table", "Insert Rows to Existing Table", "Update Rows", "Delete Rows", or "Drop Table".

3.  **Follow On-Screen Instructions**:
